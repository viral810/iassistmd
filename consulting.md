### Reduce Paper, Streamline Patient Encounters with EHR/EMR System

**Choosing an electronic medical records solution can be a frustrating process.**

You'd like to take advantage of current incentives, but don't want to get stuck with a system that ignores your unique office workflow.

Well, with EMRx you can not only cash in on early adoption incentives, you can also implement a customized solution that will parallel the current workflow of your practice.

Here's why EMRx is the right system for you:

- Simple solutions for complex workflows – EMRx was designed by physicians, and is fully customizable to match your workflow. From the appointment book to chart completion, e-prescription, and billing - there's only a single screen to navigate.
- Fast patient encounters – Physicians who use EMRx spend an average of 2 minutes documenting each patient encounter. Spend less time documenting and more time caring for patients.
- Implementation & Training – The EMRx customized implementation plan allows for comprehensive training while reducing the disruption in office workflow. You get training on your time and on your terms.

It's the right time, and EMRx is the right system for you.
